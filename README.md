How to code in Cool++ https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/941532774/ 

So if you came here from scratch, you should know how to print. But if not, heres how:
So in order to start using this coding language you need to press sapce and type "include <YetiS>" (weird name, i know) that will import some basic code syntax we can use. press space again to enter in more code, also if you made a mistake you can press "e" then type yes the type the line you made the mistake on then enter in new code, anyways back to what i was saying... press apce and enter in "print ("This is my first line of code!") " then press "r" and type "yes". that should run the code and in the terminal window you should see what you printed!

Ok now if you did that correctly, you should know how to print but now if the trickier parts:

There are a couple more pieces of code you should know in the time of making this:
First is wait. Its pretty easy! just press space and type "wait (1)" or in the place of the one, type any number you want. The wait code just waits what you put in the brackets in seconds.
Second is ask. Its like print but it asks a question or anything else. In order to use this code, press space and type: "ask ("What's your name?") " you can ask any question but thats just what i put.


Now are variables
variables are a little harder.
To use variables you need to import the variables package, to do so, press space and type in: "include <Variables> " make sure you spell it right or it won't work.
Now we asked a question but how do we know the answer? Well thats where variables come in!To print a variable (in this case, the answer), press space and type: "print (_answer)". Make sure you put an underscore before the variable name or it won't work.

Now to run the code just press "r", type yes, and the code should run!

Now printing the variable "_answer" only works when you previously answer a question or else it will return a blank character (" ").

Theres also a way to make a variable! In order to do so, press space and type: "var ("myVariable"=1234) "
You can put any name between the quotes and any value after the equal sign but always have a closing bracket at the end!!!

Now we previously only learned how to print the "_answer" variable but not out own variables.
It's pretty simular.
Just press space and type "print (_myVariable) " in the place of myVariable you can put your variable name but just remeber to put an underscore behind it!

That's all for now in the making but stay tuned for any further updates
